# Stark Bank Clojure SDK Beta

Welcome to the Stark Bank Clojure SDK! This tool is made for Clojure
developers who want to easily integrate with our API.
This SDK version is compatible with the Stark Bank API v2.

If you have no idea what Stark Bank is, check out our [website](https://www.StarkBank.com/)
and discover a world where receiving or making payments
is as easy as sending a text message to your client!

## Supported Clojure Versions

This library supports Clojure versions 1.10+.

## Stark Bank API documentation

Feel free to take a look at our [API docs](https://www.starkbank.com/docs/api).

## Versioning

This project adheres to the following versioning pattern:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment:

- MAJOR version when the **API** version is incremented. This may include backwards incompatible changes;
- MINOR version when **breaking changes** are introduced OR **new functionalities** are added in a backwards compatible manner;
- PATCH version when backwards compatible bug **fixes** are implemented.

## Setup

### 1. Install our SDK

1.1 Manually download the desired SDK version JARs found in our
[GitHub page](https://github.com/starkbank/sdk-clojure/releases/latest)
and add it to your `project.clj` as `:resource-paths ["resources/starkbank-2.0.0.jar"]`.

1.2 Using Leiningen/Boot:
```sh
[starkbank/sdk "2.0.0"]
```

1.3 Using Clojure CLI/deps.edn:
```sh
starkbank/sdk {:mvn/version "2.0.0"}
```

1.4 Using Gradle:
```sh
compile 'starkbank:sdk:2.0.0'
```

1.5 Using Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>starkbank</groupId>
  <artifactId>sdk</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Create your Private and Public Keys

We use ECDSA. That means you need to generate a secp256k1 private
key to sign your requests to our API, and register your public key
with us so we can validate those requests.

You can use one of following methods:

2.1. Check out the options in our [tutorial](https://starkbank.com/faq/how-to-create-ecdsa-keys).

2.2. Use our SDK:

```clojure
(ns my-lib.core
  (:use starkbank.core))

(def key-pair (starkbank.key/create))
(def private-key (:private-key key-pair))
(def public-key (:public-key key-pair))

;or, to also save .pem files in a specific path
(def key-pair (starkbank.key/create "file/keys/"))
(def private-key (:private-key key-pair))
(def public-key (:public-key key-pair))
```

**Note**: When you are creating a new Project, it is recommended that you create the
keys inside the infrastructure that will use it, in order to avoid risky internet
transmissions of your **private-key**. Then you can export the **public-key** alone to the
computer where it will be used in the new Project creation.

### 3. Create a Project

You need a project for direct API integrations. To create one in Sandbox:

3.1. Log into [Starkbank Sandbox](https://sandbox.web.starkbank.com)

3.2. Go to Menu > UsuÃ¡rios (Users) > Projetos (Projects)

3.3. Create a Project: Give it a name and upload the public key you created in section 2.

3.4. After creating the Project, get its Project ID

3.5. Use the Project ID and private key to create the object below:

```clojure
(ns my-lib.core
  (:use starkbank.core))

;Get your private key from an environment variable or an encrypted database.
;This is only an example of a private key content. You should use your own key.
(def private-key-content "
  -----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----
  BgUrgQQACg==
  -----END EC PARAMETERS-----
  -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
  MHQCAQEEIMCwW74H6egQkTiz87WDvLNm7fK/cA+ctA2vg/bbHx3woAcGBSuBBAAK
  oUQDQgAE0iaeEHEgr3oTbCfh8U2L+r7zoaeOX964xaAnND5jATGpD/tHec6Oe9U1
  IF16ZoTVt1FzZ8WkYQ3XomRD4HS13A==
  -----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
  ")

(def project (starkbank.user/project
    "sandbox"
    "5671398416568321"
    private-key-content
  ))

;the function output is just a map, so you can also do:

(def project {
    :environment "sandbox"
    :id "5671398416568321"
    :private-key private-key-content
  })
```

NOTE 1: Never hard-code your private key. Get it from an environment variable or an encrypted database.

NOTE 2: We support `"sandbox"` and `"production"` as environments.

NOTE 3: The project you created in `sandbox` does not exist in `production` and vice versa.


### 4. Setting up the user

There are two kinds of users that can access our API: **Project** and **Member**.

- `Member` is the one you use when you log into our webpage with your e-mail.
- `Project` is designed for integrations and is the one meant for our SDK.

There are two ways to inform the user to the SDK:
 
4.1 Passing the user as argument in all functions as the last argument:

```clojure
(ns my-lib.core
  (:use starkbank.core))

(def balance (starkbank.balance/get project))
```

4.2 Set it as a default user in the SDK:

```clojure
(ns my-lib.core
  (:use starkbank.core))

(def project {
    :environment "sandbox"
    :id "5671398416568321"
    :private-key private-key-content})
(starkbank.settings/set-default-user project)

(def balance (starkbank.balance/get))
```

Just select the way of passing the project user that is more convenient to you.
On all following examples we will assume a default user has been set in the configs.
We will also assume you are using `(:use starkbank.core)` on your code ns calls to
expose the starkbank SDK namespaces.

## Testing in Sandbox

Your initial balance is zero. For many operations in Stark Bank, you'll need funds
in your account, which can be added to your balance by creating a Boleto.

In the Sandbox environment, 90% of the created Boletos will be automatically paid,
so there's nothing else you need to do to add funds to your account. Just create
a few and wait around a bit.

In Production, you (or one of your clients) will need to actually pay this Boleto
for the value to be credited to your account.


## Usage

Here are a few examples on how to use the SDK. If you have any doubts, use the built-in
`doc` function to get more info on the desired functionality
(for example: `(doc starkbank.boleto)`)

**Note**: Almost all SDK functions also provide a bang (!) version. To simplify the examples, they will be used the most throughout this README.

### Create transactions

To send money between Stark Bank accounts, you can create transactions:

```clojure
(def transactions
  (starkbank.transaction/create
    [
      {
        :amount 100; (R$ 1,00)
        :receiver-id "5768064935133184"
        :description "Transaction to dear provider"
        :external-id "12345"; so we can block anything you send twice by mistake
        :tags ["provider"]
      }
      {
        :amount 234; (R$ 2,34)
        :receiver-id "5768064935133184"
        :description "Transaction to the other provider"
        :external-id "12346"; so we can block anything you send twice by mistake
        :tags ["provider"]
      }
    ]))

(println transactions)
```

### Query transactions

To understand your balance changes (bank statement), you can query
transactions. Note that our system creates transactions for you when
you receive boleto payments, pay a bill or make transfers, for example.

```clojure
(def transactions
  (starkbank.transaction/query
    {
      :after "2020-03-20"
      :before "2020-03-30"
      :limit 10
    }))

(println transactions)
```

### Get transaction

You can get a specific transaction by its id:

```clojure
(def transaction (starkbank.transaction/get "6677396233125888"))

(println transaction)
```

### Get balance

To know how much money you have in your workspace, run:

```clojure
(def balance (starkbank.balance/get))

(println (double (/ (:amount balance) 100)))
```

### Create transfers

You can also create transfers in the SDK (TED/PIX).

```clojure
(def transfers
  (starkbank.transfer/create
    [
      {
        :amount 100
        :bank-code "20018183"; PIX
        :branch-code "0001"
        :account-number "10000-0"
        :tax-id "012.345.678-90"
        :name "Tony Stark"
        :tags ["iron" "suit"]
      }
      {
        :amount 200
        :bank-code "341"; TED
        :branch-code "1234"
        :account-number "123456-7"
        :tax-id "012.345.678-90"
        :name "Jon Snow"
      }
    ]))

(println transfers)
```

### Query transfers

You can query multiple transfers according to filters.

```clojure
(def transfers
  (starkbank.transfer/query
    {
      :after "2020-11-01"
      :before "2020-12-01"
      :limit 10
    }))

(println transfers)
```

### Get transfer

To get a single transfer by its id, run:

```clojure
(def transfer (starkbank.transfer/get "4882890932355072"))

(println transfer)
```

### Get transfer PDF

A transfer PDF may also be retrieved by passing its id.
This operation is only valid for transfers with "processing" or "success" status.

```clojure
(clojure.java.io/copy
  (starkbank.transfer/pdf "4882890932355072")
  (clojure.java.io/file "transfer.pdf"))
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Query transfer logs

You can query transfer logs to better understand transfer life cycles.

```clojure
(def logs
  (starkbank.transfer.log/query
    {
      :limit 50
    }))

(println logs)
```

### Get a transfer log

You can also get a specific log by its id.

```clojure
(def log (starkbank.transfer.log/get "6610264099127296"))

(println log)
```

### Create invoices

You can create dynamic QR Code invoices to charge customers or to receive money from accounts
you have in other banks.

```clojure
(def invoices (starkbank.invoice/create
  [{
    :amount 400000
    :due "2020-12-25T19:32:35.418698+00:00"
    :tax-id "012.345.678-90"
    :name "Iron Bank S.A.",
    :expiration 123456789,
    :fine 2.5,
    :interest 1.3,
    :discounts [
      {
        :percentage 5
        :due "2020-12-20T19:32:35.418698+00:00"
      }
      {
        :percentage 3
        :due "2020-12-22T19:32:35.418698+00:00"
      }
    ]
    :descriptions [
      {
        :key "Product X"
        :value "big"
      }
    ]
    :tags [
      "War supply",
      "Invoice #1234"
    ]
  }]))

(doseq [invoice invoices]
  (println invoice))
```

**Note**: Instead of using Invoice objects, you can also pass each invoice element in dictionary format

### Get an invoice

After its creation, information on an invoice may be retrieved by its id. 
Its status indicates whether it's been paid.

```clojure
(def invoice (starkbank.invoice/get "6750458353811456"))

(println invoice)
```

### Get an invoice PDF

After its creation, an invoice PDF may be retrieved by its id.

  (starkbank.invoice/pdf "6750458353811456")
  (clojure.java.io/file "invoice.pdf"))
```

### Get an invoice QR Code

After its creation, an Invoice QR Code may be retrieved by its id. 

```clojure
(clojure.java.io/copy
  (starkbank.invoice/qrcode "6750458353811456")
  (clojure.java.io/file "invoice.png"))
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw png content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file.

### Cancel an invoice

You can also cancel an invoice by its id.
Note that this is not possible if it has been paid already.

```clojure
(def invoice (starkbank.invoice/update (:id "6750458353811456") {:status "canceled"}))

(println invoice)
```

### Update an invoice

You can update an invoice's amount, due date and expiration by its id.
Note that this is not possible if it has been paid already.

```clojure
(def invoices (starkbank.invoice/update ((:id "6750458353811456") {:amount 10 :expiration 600 :due "2020-12-20T19:32:35.418698+00:00"})))

(doseq [invoice invoices]
  (println invoice))
```

### Query invoices

You can get a list of created invoices given some filters.

```clojure

(def invoices (starkbank.invoice/query {:limit 5 :status "created"}))

```

### Create boletos

You can create boletos to charge customers or to receive money from accounts
you have in other banks.

```clojure
(def boletos (starkbank.boleto/create [{
  :amount 23571; R$ 235,71
  :name "Buzz Aldrin"
  :tax-id "012.345.678-90"

  :fine 5; 5%
  :interest 2.5; 2.5% per month
}]))

(println boletos)
```

### Get boleto

After its creation, information on a boleto may be retrieved by passing its id.
Its status indicates whether it's been paid.

```clojure
(def boleto (starkbank.boleto/get "6750458353811456"))

(println boleto)
```

### Get boleto PDF

After its creation, a boleto PDF may be retrieved by passing its id.

```clojure
(clojure.java.io/copy
  (starkbank.boleto/pdf "6750458353811456")
  (clojure.java.io/file "boleto.pdf"))
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Delete boleto

You can also cancel a boleto by its id.
Note that this is not possible if it has been processed already.

```clojure
(def boleto (starkbank.boleto/delete "5202697619767296"))

(println boleto)
```

### Query boletos

You can get a stream of created boletos given some filters.

```clojure
(def boletos
  (starkbank.boleto/query
    {
      :after "2020-09-05",
      :before "2020-10-02"
      :limit 10
    }))

(println boletos)
```

### Query boleto logs

Logs are pretty important to understand the life cycle of a boleto.

```clojure
(def logs
  (starkbank.boleto.log/query
    {
      :boleto-ids ["6750458353811456"]
    }))

(println logs)
```

### Get a boleto log

You can get a single log by its id.

```clojure
(def log (starkbank.boleto.log/get "6288576484474880"))

(println log)
```

### Investigate a boleto

You can discover if a StarkBank boleto has been recently paid before we receive the response on the next day. This can be done by creating a BoletoHolmes object, which fetches the updated status of the corresponding Boleto object according to CIP to check, for example, whether it is still payable or not. The investigation happens asynchronously and the most common way to retrieve the results is to register a "boleto-holmes" webhook subscription, although polling is also possible. 

```clojure
(def holmes (starkbank.boleto-holmes/create
  [{
    :boleto-id "5656565656565656"
    :tags ["investigating product x"]
  }]))

(doseq [sherlock holmes]
  (println sherlock))
```

### Get boleto holmes

To get a single boleto holmes by its id, run:

```clojure
(def sherlock (starkbank.boleto-holmes/get "5656565656565656"))

(println sherlock)
```

### Query boleto holmes

You can search for boleto holmes using filters. 

```clojure
(def holmes (starkbank.boleto-holmes/query {:limit 10, :after "2020-11-01", :before "2020-12-01"}))

(doseq [sherlock holmes]
  (println sherlock))
```

### Query boleto holmes logs

Searches are also possible with boleto holmes logs:

```clojure
(def logs (starkbank.boleto-holmes.log/query {:limit 10 :type "solved"}))

(doseq [log logs]
  (println log))
```

### Get boleto holmes log

You can also get a boleto holmes log by specifying its id.

```clojure
(def log (starkbank.boleto-holmes.log/get "5656565656565656"))

(println log)
```

### Preview a BR Code payment

You can confirm the information on the BR Code payment before creating it with this preview method:

```clojure
(def previews (starkbank.brcode-preview/query {:brcodes brcodes}))

(doseq [preview previews]
  (println preview))
```

### Pay a BR Code

Paying a BR Code is also simple.

```clojure
(def payments (starkbank.brcode-payment/create
  [{
    :brcode "00020126580014br.gov.bcb.pix0136a629532e-7693-4846-852d-1bbff817b5a8520400005303986540510.005802BR5908T'Challa6009Sao Paulo62090505123456304B14A"
    :tax-id "20.018.183/0001-80"

      }
      {
        :line "83680000001 7 08430138003 0 71070987611 8 00041351685 7"
        :scheduled "2020-05-11"
        :description "never ending bills"
        :tags ["again"]
      }
    ]))

(println payments)
```

### Query utility payments

To search for utility payments using filters, run:

```clojure
(def payments
  (starkbank.utility-payment/query
    {
      :tags ["electricity" "gas"]
      :limit 10
    }))

(println payments)
```

### Get utility payment

You can get a specific bill by its id:

```clojure
(def payment (starkbank.utility-payment/get "6619425641857024"))

(println payment)
```

### Get utility payment PDF

After its creation, a utility payment PDF may also be retrieved by passing its id.

```clojure
(clojure.java.io/copy
  (starkbank.utility-payment/pdf "4663663059271680")
  (clojure.java.io/file "utility-payment.pdf"))
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Delete utility payment

You can also cancel a utility payment by its id.
Note that this is not possible if it has been processed already.

```clojure
(def payment (starkbank.utility-payment/delete "6619425641857024"))

(println payment)
```

### Query utility payment logs

You can search for payments by specifying filters. Use this to understand the
bills life cycles.

```clojure
(def logs
  (starkbank.utility-payment.log/query
    {
      :payment-ids ["6619425641857024" "5738969660653568"]
    }))

(println logs)
```

### Get utility payment log

If you want to get a specific payment log by its id, just run:

```clojure
(def log (starkbank.utility-payment.log/get "6197807794880512"))

(println log)
```

### Create payment requests to be approved by authorized people in a cost center 

You can also request payments that must pass through a specific cost center approval flow to be executed. In certain structures, this allows double checks for cash-outs and also gives time to load your account with the required amount before the payments take place. The approvals can be granted at our website and must be performed according to the rules specified in the cost center.

**Note**: The value of the center\_id parameter can be consulted by logging into our website and going
to the desired cost center page.

```clojure
(def payment {
      :amount 200
      :name "Dumlocks von z'Blurbows"
      :tax-id "012.345.678-90"
      :bank-code "60701190"
      :branch-code "0001"
      :account-number "00000-0"
      :tags ["testing" "clojure"]
    })

(def requests (starkbank.payment-request/create
  [{
    :type type
    :payment payment
    :center-id "5656565656565656"
    :tags ["testing" "clojure"]
    :due "2020-12-11"
  }]))

(doseq [request requests]
  (println request))
```

**Note**: Instead of using PaymentRequest objects, you can also pass each request element in dictionary format


### Query payment requests

To search for payment requests, run:

```clojure
(def requests (starkbank.payment-request/query {
  :limit 3
  :status ["success"]
  :center-id "5656565656565656")})

(doseq [request requests]
  (println request))
```

### Create a webhook subscription

To create a webhook subscription and be notified whenever an event occurs, run:

```clojure
(def webhook
  (starkbank.webhook/create
    {
      :url "https://webhook.site/dd784f26-1d6a-4ca6-81cb-fda0267761ec"
      :subscriptions ["transfer" "boleto" "boleto-payment" "utility-payment"]
    }))

(println webhook)
```

### Query webhooks

To search for registered webhooks, run:

```clojure
(def webhooks (starkbank.webhook/query))

(println webhooks)
```

### Get webhook

You can get a specific webhook by its id.

```clojure
(def webhook (starkbank.webhook/get "6178044066660352"))

(println webhook)
```

### Delete webhook

You can also delete a specific webhook by its id.

```clojure
(def webhook (starkbank.webhook/delete "5083659757420544"))

(println webhook)
```

### Process webhook events

It's easy to process events that have arrived in your webhook. Remember to pass the
signature header so the SDK can make sure it's really StarkBank that has sent you
the event.

```clojure
(def response (listen)); this is the function you made to get the events posted to your webhook

(def event
  (starkbank.event/parse
    (:content response)
    (:Digital-Signature (:headers response))))

(println event)
```

If the data does not check out with the Stark Bank public-key, the function will automatically request the
key from the API and try to validate the signature once more. If it still does not check out, it will raise an error.

### Query webhook events

To search for webhooks events, run:

```clojure
(def events
  (starkbank.event/query
    {
      :after "2020-03-20"
      :is-delivered false
      :limit 10
    }))

(println events)
```

### Get webhook event

You can get a specific webhook event by its id.

```clojure
(def event (starkbank.event/get "6597859067559936"))

(println event)
```

### Delete webhook event

You can also delete a specific webhook event by its id.

```clojure
(def event (starkbank.event/delete "4568139664719872"))

(println event)
```

### Get DICT key

You can get PIX key's parameters by its id.

```clojure
(def dict-key (starkbank.dict-key/get "tony@starkbank.com"))

(println dict-key)
```

### Query your DICT keys

To take a look at the PIX keys linked to your workspace, just run the following:

```clojure
(def dict-keys (starkbank.dict-key/query {:limit 5}))

(doseq [dict-key dict-keys]
  (printn dict-key))
```


### Set webhook events as delivered

This can be used in case you've lost events.
With this function, you can manually set events retrieved from the API as
"delivered" to help future event queries with `is_delivered: false`.

```clojure
(def event (starkbank.event/update "5764442407043072" {:is-delivered true}))

(println event)
```

## Handling errors

The SDK may raise one of four types of errors: __InputErrors__, __InternalServerError__, __UnknownException__, __InvalidSignatureException__

__InputErrors__ will be raised whenever the API detects an error in your request (status code 400).
If you catch such an error, you can get its elements to verify each of the
individual errors that were detected in your request by the API.

For example:

```clojure
(try
  (starkbank.transaction/create [
    {
      :amount -200
      :receiver-id "123"
      :description "."
      :external-id "repeated id"
      :tags ["error" "example"]
    }
  ])
  (catch com.starkbank.error.InputErrors e
    (map
      (fn [element] (str "error-code: " (.code element) "\nerror-message: " (.message element)))
      (.errors e))))
```

__InternalServerError__ will be raised if the API runs into an internal error.
If you ever stumble upon this one, rest assured that the development team
is already rushing in to fix the mistake and get you back up to speed.

__UnknownException__ will be raised if a request encounters an error that is
neither __InputErrors__ nor an __InternalServerError__, such as connectivity problems.

__InvalidSignatureException__ will be raised specifically by starkbank.event.parse()
when the provided content and signature do not check out with the Stark Bank public
key.
